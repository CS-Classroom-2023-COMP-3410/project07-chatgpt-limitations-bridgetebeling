What I Changed:
The game now tracks whose turn it is and displays it on the screen.
Players take turns flipping two cards, just like in a real head-to-head memory match.
If a player gets a match, they keep their turn—no unfair turn switching!
The game keeps score for both players, showing how many matches each has found.
At the end, it declares a winner based on who has more matches (or calls a tie if it's even).
Final Thoughts:
This feature makes the game way more interactive and fun for two people playing together. It keeps the core memory game mechanics intact while adding real multiplayer strategy. Everything is working perfectly now, and the grid stays visible (unlike what happened with ChatGPT’s earlier attempts).

What I Changed:
Made the game window resize properly and stay inside the fruit border.
Shrunk the cards and adjusted the grid layout so everything fits inside the white box instead of overflowing.
The whole thing stays centered and scales correctly, no matter what screen size you're on.
Fixed an issue where the game wouldnâ€™t even show up after clicking Start (super frustrating).
